# The Binary prediction of rainfall challenge

This challenge is featured in Kaggle's playground series [March 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e3) edition.

The **goal** of this challenge is to predict rainfall for each day of the year.

**Evaluation metric**: [area under the ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) between the predicted probability and the observed target.

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subho117/rainfall-prediction-using-machine-learning) dataset. 

Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.
